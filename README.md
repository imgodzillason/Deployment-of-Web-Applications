# Portfolio Deployment Plan

This deployment plan outlines the process of putting my site onto the live server using Git

*The assumption for this plan is its use with a single HTML page. For more complex sites, the recommendation is to use additional branches in order to merge as needed.*

1. Save changes to local repository

2. Commit changes to Git repository
    * **git commit -a** to commit all files.
        * **This will save all changes in the directory.**
    * **git commit -m "Commit message here"** to commit the staged snapshot and add commit message.
    * Use **git add** to select specific files to push
