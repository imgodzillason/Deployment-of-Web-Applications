# Portfolio Deployment Plan

This deployment plan outlines the process of putting my site onto the live server using Git

*The assumption for this plan is its use with a single HTML page. For more complex sites, the recommendation is to use additional branches in order to merge as needed.*

1. Save changes to local repository

2. Commit changes to Git repository
    * **git commit -a to commit all files**
    * **git commit -m "Commit message here" to commit the staged snapshot**
